### This application represents the outcome of the migration process.

The steps involved were as follows:

1. Remove all components and configurations related to JSF (JavaServer Faces) and transition to a fully 
   *REST-based architecture*.
2. Create a new project using Spring Initializr as the foundation.
3. **Migrate one API at a time**, ensuring each is tested and functional before moving forward, and begin
   decommissioning the legacy components as soon as their REST-based replacements are ready.
